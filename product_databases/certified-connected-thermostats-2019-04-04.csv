Since 2008, ecobee has offered flexible demand response services solutions to various utilities across North America.  Our thermostats are currently involved in more than 20 demand response programs across North America.  ecobee thermostats are designed to respond to demand response signals, and our company provides head-end related demand response event execution services. These services allow utility customers to configure and tailor their event strategies as required, while also allowing them to alter their strategies for different groups of customers.  In addition, we are integrated and work with various Demand Response Management Systems (DRMS) service provider platforms and/or software.  Through these DRMS integrations, utility and other utility services companies can provide the seamless customer communication required for demand response and demand management. Our integration with various DRMS platforms, along with the data we collect, also facilitates locational demand response.

Our thermostat has participated in demand management via load dispatch, as well as time-of-use pricing response. The S100 thermostat offers a robust set of RESTful APIs to partners, allowing for straight-forward integration. Available for partner use are both a “Thermostat API Specification” and “DR API Specification,” offering server-to-server communications specific to general thermostat control, and demand response control, respectively.EcoFactor supports locational DR, allowing users to create “groups” based on segmenting features. Zip code is the primary characteristic used for segmentation, but custom groups are also possible. As an OpenADR member, EcoFactor is committed to openness and interoperability.EcoFactor reports run-time and thermostat performance at minute intervals, allowing for detailed measurement and verification of performance, including measurement of overrides. EcoFactor also records the type of HVAC equipment controlled by thermostat and continuously measures and records indoor and set point temperatures. Thermostat customers receive detailed reporting on thermostat run- time and savings versus baseline.EcoFactor is a leader in creating smart optimization, allowing for users to receive both energy efficiency– resulting in 10-15 percent annual savings on HVAC use – as well as optimized demand management, which prioritizes comfort through approaches such as pre-cooling and in-event cycling. Events can be configured by DR program managers including timing, duration, degree of cycling/offset, load shaping, and grouping.
