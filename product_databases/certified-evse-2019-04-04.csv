The output can be reduced by either a percent of the present load or set to a fixed kilowatt maximum value at the group or individual EVSE level.  ChargePoint offers an OpenADR 2.0b certified Virtual End Node interface for receiving pricing signals and demand response commands, which can be mapped to a designated group of EVSE (e.g. site, feeder, zip code, etc.) for the purpose of controlling load either directly or as a response to a pricing signal.  Pricing signals received over the network on a daily basis may be passed on to the driver or site host.  ChargePoint also offers a SOAP based web services API and a web based interface for controlling load of a group of EVSE or an individual EVSE.  In addition, EVSE can be scheduled to raise or lower output power at the individual or group level, such that the power output could be set to a different level at each 15 minute interval of the day on a recurring basis.  Near real-time load and status of the EVSE can be read from the OpenADR, SOAP API, and web interface for the purpose of feedback into a load management system, and historical reports of peak power, average power, and energy dispensed are available as clock aligned 15 minute intervals and charging session summaries.  Depending upon the type of load management program controlling the EVSE, drivers may have the option to override a power management event either through a mobile app, or by using a technique from the industry called the double pump, which is simply plugging in, unplugging, and plugging in the connector again within five seconds.
